/**
 * Subscription plumbing for a trusted first-party front end.
 *
 * The caller sells a subscription elsewhere and needs three things from
 * Studio: whether an account exists, the ability to grant and revoke access as
 * that subscription changes, and the organization's API key so it can write the
 * brief. Nothing here is reachable without the shared secret, and none of it is
 * part of the public API.
 *
 * It deliberately cannot create an account. Customers sign up through Studio
 * itself, which is what ties a workspace to a person who proved they hold that
 * email. An endpoint that could mint accounts on a shared secret was a large
 * capability to leave sitting behind one string, and nothing needs it.
 *
 * Deliberately kept dumb about billing: the caller says when access should
 * lapse and this writes it down. Studio never asks who was paid or how much,
 * which keeps the payment provider entirely on the caller's side.
 *
 * The grant is always time limited. `subscriptionService.whitelistOrganization`
 * can grant forever by passing a null date, and that is exactly what must not
 * happen here: access has to follow the subscription, so a customer who stops
 * paying stops having access.
