          Deletion covers our live systems immediately and encrypted backups
          within 30 days, after which the data cannot be restored. We keep only
          what law requires us to keep — billing records for six years under UK
          tax law. Content you already published to a social platform stays on
          that platform; deleting it there is done from the platform itself.

          Access tokens are encrypted at rest. Traffic to and from the service
          is encrypted in transit with TLS. Access to production systems is

          secure, but we take reasonable and appropriate technical and
          organisational measures to protect your data, and we will notify you
