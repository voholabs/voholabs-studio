          These terms are the agreement between you and us for Voholabs Studio,
          the social media scheduling tool at studio.voholabs.com. By creating
          an account, signing in, or using the service in any way, including
          through the API, a webhook, an MCP connection or an AI assistant, you
          agree to them. You confirm that by ticking the box when you sign up,
          and we keep a record of the version you agreed to, when, and from
          which IP address.
          If you use the service for a company or other
          organisation, you agree to them on its behalf and confirm you are
          allowed to do so. If you do not agree, do not use the service.

      <LegalSection id="about" title="1. About us">
        <p>
          Voholabs Studio is provided by Voholabs Ltd, a company registered in
          England and Wales with company number 17214002, whose registered
          office is at 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2H 9JQ,
          United Kingdom. In these terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;
          and &quot;Voholabs&quot; mean that company. You can contact us at{' '}
          <Mail />.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="business-use" title="2. Business use only">
        <p>
          Voholabs Studio is offered only to businesses and professionals. By
          using it you confirm that you are using it wholly or mainly for
          purposes relating to your trade, business, craft or profession, and
          not as a consumer. We offer the service free, and on these terms,
          because you give us that confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old, or the minimum age required by the
          platforms you connect, whichever is higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, despite your confirmation, the law treats you as a consumer, this
          paragraph applies instead of paragraphs 14.2 to 14.11. We will provide
          the service with reasonable care and skill. If we fail to, we are
          responsible for loss or damage you suffer that was a foreseeable
          result of that failure. We are not responsible for business losses,
          because the service is not offered for personal use, or for loss that
          was not foreseeable, that you could have avoided by following section
          8 or keeping your own copies, or that was caused by a platform or by
          anyone acting through your workspace. Nothing in these terms affects
          your legal rights as a consumer. You can bring a claim in the courts
          of the part of the United Kingdom, or the country, where you live.

      <LegalSection id="free-plan" title="3. The service and the free plan">
        <p>
          Voholabs Studio lets you connect social media accounts, compose posts,
          schedule them to publish at chosen times, manage a shared media
          library, work with team members, connect the API, webhooks or an AI
          assistant, and view analytics for the content you published through
          the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scheduling is free. The free plan has no set limit on connected
          channels or scheduled posts, and includes the calendar, team members,
          up to 30 webhooks, the public API and the MCP connection for AI
          assistants. We do not ask for a card. In return we ask every new
          account a few questions, and we may contact you about Voholabs
          services, as the{' '}

          of Apex, the managed content service we sell at voholabs.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apex is ordered, billed and cancelled through voholabs.com, with
          payment taken by Stripe. Apex fees, renewal, cancellation and refunds
          are governed by the{' '}

          GB storage cap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paying for Apex does not create a service level, an uptime commitment
          or a support commitment for the scheduler, unless we have agreed one
          with you in a signed written order. AI output can be wrong, offensive,

        <p>
          Connecting a channel authorises Voholabs Studio to act on that
          platform, strictly within the permissions you granted and only to
          carry out what you or your workspace instruct. You confirm that you
          own or are authorised to manage every account you connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The risk to your social accounts is yours.</strong> Each
          network decides for itself whether to rate-limit, restrict, label,
          reduce the reach of, suspend or ban an account, or to remove content.
          It may do so because of automation, posting volume, the content, a
          change in its rules, or for no stated reason. Using a scheduling tool
          does not protect you from that and may be a factor in it. We have no
          say in those decisions and cannot reverse them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our own access can be taken away.</strong> We connect to each
          network through developer access that the network has approved and can
          limit, suspend or withdraw at any time. If that happens, every user of
          that network may be disconnected at once, without notice, and
          scheduled posts for it will not publish.
        </p>
        <p>

          You are the publisher of everything that goes out through your

          You are responsible for your content: that you hold the rights to it,
          that it is lawful, accurate and not defamatory, that it respects other
          people&apos;s privacy and confidentiality, that it is properly
          labelled where a platform or the law requires a label (for example
          advertising, paid partnerships or AI-generated media), and that it
          complies with the rules of every platform you publish it to. If you
          work in a regulated field, such as financial services, health, legal
          services, gambling or alcohol, compliance with the rules on what you
          may say and when is yours alone. Nothing in the service is legal,

      <LegalSection id="reliability" title="8. Scheduled posts can fail">
        <p>
          Publishing depends on our systems, on each platform&apos;s API and on
          the state of your connected account, so we do not promise that any
          post goes out, or goes out on time. A scheduled post may fail, be
          delayed, publish more than once, publish at the wrong time (including
          because of a time zone or queue fault), publish to the wrong channel,
          publish with missing or wrong media or formatting, or publish after
          you edited, unscheduled or deleted it. A draft may be published if it
          is scheduled by you, a team member or a connected tool. Causes include
          a platform being down or changing its API, an expired token, a
          platform rejecting the content, and faults or maintenance in our own
          service.

          When we are told about content in this way we will look at the report

          <strong>14.1 The only exceptions.</strong> Nothing in these terms
          excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused
          by our negligence, for our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or
          for any liability that the law does not allow anybody to exclude or
          limit. Everything else in this section is subject to this paragraph
          and to section 2. These and section 2 are the only exceptions to this
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.2 No liability.</strong> We are not liable to you for any
          loss or damage of any kind, however it is caused, that arises out of
          or in connection with the service or these terms. You use the service
          entirely at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.3 Leaks, hacks and security.</strong> We are not liable for
          any loss arising from unauthorised access to, or the leak, disclosure,
          theft, loss, alteration or misuse of, your Studio account, your
          connected social accounts and pages, your passwords, API keys and

          a mistake by us, a provider we rely on, or anything on your side.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.4 Your social accounts and other platforms.</strong> We are
          not liable for any loss arising from a platform rate-limiting,
          restricting, labelling, reducing the reach of, suspending, banning or
          closing any account, page, channel, profile or advertising account, or
          removing any content; from the loss of followers, reach, engagement,
          monetisation or access on any platform; from a platform changing,
          limiting, breaking or withdrawing its API, its rules or its service;
          from a platform outage; or from our own access to a platform being
          limited, suspended or withdrawn.

        <p>
          <strong>14.5 Publishing.</strong> We are not liable for any loss
          arising from a post that fails, is delayed, is published more than
          once, at the wrong time, to the wrong channel, with missing or wrong
          media or formatting, or after it was edited, unscheduled or deleted.

          <strong>14.6 People and tools acting through your workspace.</strong>{' '}
          We are not liable for any loss arising from anything done by a team
          member, a former team member, or anyone or anything using your
          password, API key, webhook, MCP connection or connected AI assistant,
          script or third-party tool, or from what the provider of such a tool
          does with data it obtains.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.7 Availability and data.</strong> We are not liable for any
          loss arising from the service being unavailable, slow, changed,
          limited or withdrawn, from uploads being refused at the storage cap,
          from an account being suspended or closed under section 11, or from
          the loss, corruption or deletion of content or data held in the
          service.

          <strong>14.8 Types of loss.</strong> We are not liable, whether the
          loss is direct or indirect, for loss of profit; loss of revenue or
          sales; loss of business, contracts or opportunity; loss of anticipated
          savings; loss of goodwill or reputation; wasted staff or management
          time; fines or penalties imposed on you; claims made against you by
          anybody else; or any indirect or consequential loss.

        <p>
          <strong>14.9 Events outside our control.</strong> We are not liable
          for a failure or delay caused by something outside our reasonable
          control, including failures of hosting, storage, email, network or
          platform providers, attacks on the service, and acts of government.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.10 Overall cap.</strong> If we are liable to you for any
          reason, our total liability to you for all claims arising out of or in
          connection with these terms and the service, added together, is
          limited to the greater of (a) the amounts you paid us for Voholabs
          Studio in the 12 months before the first event that gave rise to a
          claim and (b) £100. This paragraph stands by itself and applies
          whether or not any other paragraph of this section applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.11 Time limit.</strong> You must start any claim against us
          within 12 months of the date you first knew, or ought reasonably to
          have known, of the facts that give rise to it. After that the claim is
          barred.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.12 How this section works.</strong> Paragraphs 14.2 to
          14.11 apply to liability of every kind, whether in contract, tort
          (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, misrepresentation or
          otherwise, and to us, our directors, staff and contractors. Each
          paragraph, and each item within it, is a separate term. If a court
          finds one of them unenforceable, the others continue to apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.13 Why this is fair.</strong> We charge nothing for the
          service, and we could not offer it on that basis if we carried the
          risks of your business. You are told this plainly on the sign-up
          screen, before you can create an account, and in the summary at the
          top of these terms. Most of these risks are in your hands: you can
          check that posts went out, keep copies of your content, control who
          and what has access to your workspace and your social accounts, revoke
          our access at the platform at any time, use two-factor authentication,
          and insure your business. If you need service levels, support or
          contractual remedies, paid services offer them and you are free to use
          one. You accept that this section is reasonable on that basis.

        <p>
          You will indemnify us against all losses, damages, fines, costs and

          claim, complaint, demand or enforcement action by a third party,
          including a platform or a regulator, that arises from: content stored
          or published through your workspace; an account you connected;
          anything done by a person or tool acting through your workspace; your
          breach of section 9 or of a platform&apos;s rules; or personal data
          you put into the service without a lawful basis.

        <p>

          is handled, and take reasonable steps to keep the cost down. The
          limits in section 14 apply to our liability, not to yours under this
