Use integrationList first to get the channel id. Only social channels report analytics; publishing platforms such as a blog or a newsletter return nothing, which is expected rather than an error.
What comes back differs by network, because each one exposes its own metrics. Read the labels rather than assuming a fixed set, and say which network the numbers came from.
Numbers can be a day or two behind what the network's own dashboard shows, so do not present them as live.
Results are cached for up to an hour: "cachedAt" says when they were read from the network and "note" says whether this answer came from the cache. Pass fresh: true to read the network again; on a workspace that pays from its wallet that can charge post reads (each post at most once per UTC day, whichever period or refresh reads it first; see walletPrices), so only do it when the user wants newer numbers.
A wallet workspace whose credits are used up gets no live read: "error" then says so with a top-up link (cached numbers are still returned).`,
