What matters is a rule that came back different from how you left it: that is somebody telling you the rule was wrong, and their version is the one to keep. Never restore what they removed.
Returns one entry per document, with the rules added, removed or rewritten. Removed words are marked [-like this-] and added words {+like this+}.
Work out what the change implies beyond the document it happened in, write that down with briefLearnTool, then call markLearnedTool with kind "brief" and the ids returned here, so the same edit is not reviewed again.`,
