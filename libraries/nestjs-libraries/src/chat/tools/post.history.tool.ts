      description: `Compare the post as it was first drafted with the post that actually went out. Every difference is a change somebody made during review, and that is the only way to find out what this brand wants that you did not already know.
By default it returns the posts still waiting to be reviewed: ones that published, whose text or media differ from the original draft, and that have not been learned from yet. Posts that went out untouched never appear — there is nothing to compare. Nothing else in the product reads this; it exists for you.
Read each diff and ask what would have to be true for the draft to have come out the way it finally went. Removed words are marked [-like this-] and added words {+like this+}; media and per-channel settings are listed separately.
When a change teaches something that would apply again, write it down with briefLearnTool. Then call markLearnedTool for those chainIds with outcome RECORDED, or NO_SIGNAL when the edits were only typos, formatting or one-off details worth nothing next time. Either way the chain leaves the queue, so nothing is reviewed twice.`,
