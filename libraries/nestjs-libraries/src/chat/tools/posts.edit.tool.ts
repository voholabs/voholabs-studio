      description: `Change a post that is already on the calendar, in place. Use postsList to find it, then pass its "id".
This is how you rewrite a post's text — never delete and re-create it for that. The post keeps its id, its channel, its settings and, above all, its attachments: anything you do not pass is left exactly as it was, so editing the words of a post that carries a video keeps that video on it.
Pass only what changes. "content" replaces the text of the post itself; "comments" replaces the thread items / comments after it; "attachments" replaces the media on the post; "date" moves it; "settings" is merged over the settings it already has, so you can fix one key without resending the rest.
The output reports the post as it now stands, including its attachments, so you can confirm the media survived.

What it does to the schedule:
- A queued post stays queued and its publishing job is rebuilt around the new content. If its date has already passed, it can go out immediately — pass a future "date" if you are editing something overdue.
- A draft stays a draft.
- A post that has ALREADY PUBLISHED can only be corrected on the calendar. The message live on the social network is not touched, and the tool tells you so ("livePostUnchanged"). Say that to the user rather than letting them believe the live post changed.

To remove media rather than replace it, pass "clearAttachments" — an empty "attachments" array is treated as "no change", so it cannot silently strip a video.`,
