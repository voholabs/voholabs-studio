      description: `List the posts already on the calendar between two dates, so you can tell the user what is scheduled or find the post they want to change or delete.
Dates are UTC ISO strings. If you don't pass any, it defaults to the next ${DEFAULT_RANGE_IN_DAYS} days — pass a start date in the past to look at posts that were already published.
Every post returns both an "id" and a "group": the group holds a post together with its thread items and comments, and is what deletePostTool removes.
Every post also returns "attachments" — the media it carries, with the same "path" the media library uses. That is how you tell whether a post already has its image or video on it, without opening anything.
A thread comes back whole: "comments" lists the items that follow the post, in order, each with its own text and attachments. Their position in that list is the "commentIndex" replacePostAsset takes, so this is where you find which item carries the image you were asked to change.
TO GET AT the media rather than just know it exists, pass the "path" values to mediaPreview: it returns a loadable resource link per item, in slide order, for video as well as images. Load those URLs yourself to see or use the asset — nothing is inlined and nothing is re-encoded, so what you load is the real thing at full quality. Each attachment also carries "mediaId", "originalName" and a "mimeType" hint, so you can tell a video from an image before you load anything.
TO CHANGE A POST, use editPostTool with its "id". It edits in place and keeps whatever you do not pass, attachments included. Deleting and re-creating a post is not the way to reword it: it loses the media, the post's history and its id.

Every post returns its "settings" too — the channel options it was scheduled with, such as which Discord channel it goes to or an X post's reply permissions and AI-disclosure flags. That is what you read back when you need to know how a post is configured, and what editPostTool merges into rather than replacing.

TO LINK ONE POST TO ANOTHER (echoing a post to another channel): every post here returns a "linkReference" like "(post:<id>)". Put that string in another post's content and it is replaced with this post's real URL at the moment that post publishes. It works while "releaseURL" is still null - a queued post has no URL yet, and that is exactly the case this is for. Never copy "releaseURL" to build an echo; use "linkReference".
"references" lists the posts THIS one points at. A chain is only as good as its links: if a post it references is deleted, the reference can never resolve and this post fails at publish time instead of going out with a broken link — a silent no-show. So edit posts rather than deleting them, and check what a delete would break before you run it (deletePostTool refuses and names them).`,
