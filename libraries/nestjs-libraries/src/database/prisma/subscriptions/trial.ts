 *                               existed before the trial shipped)

 *                               plan: scheduling stays, everything that costs

 * Organizations without any row at all keep the previous behaviour: unlimited
 * when billing is not configured, blocked when it is. That keeps self hosted
 * installs working and makes a missed backfill fail open instead of locking
 * people out.
