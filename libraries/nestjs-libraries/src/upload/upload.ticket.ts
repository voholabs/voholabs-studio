// Short-lived, single-use tickets that let an agent push a local file into the
// media library without ever holding the organization's API key.
//
// The MCP tool mints a ticket (it is already authenticated as the org) and
// hands back a URL; the agent POSTs the file to that URL as multipart form
// data. The receiving route is unauthenticated by design — the ticket itself
// is the credential — so it is a 256-bit random token, expires quickly, is
// burned on the first successful upload, and can only ever add a file to the
// organization it was minted for.
